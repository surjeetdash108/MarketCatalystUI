 *   - Firebase Hosting (deployed)        -> same-origin, i.e. the Firebase base
 *     URL. firebase.json rewrites /api, /market-data and /live to the backend
 *     Cloud Run service, so there is no CORS and responses are CDN-cacheable.
 *
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL is honoured only as an explicit REMOTE override (e.g.
 * pointing a local UI at a deployed backend). A localhost value is ignored once
 * the page itself is served from a real host, so a dev env baked into a
 * production build can never misroute deployed traffic back to localhost.

 *
 * REST goes same-origin so Firebase Hosting can CDN-cache it. But Hosting's CDN
 * BUFFERS a long-lived streaming response: an EventSource opened at the
 * same-origin rewrite never receives a frame (the whole reason useTapeStream /
 * useLiveTick also carry a REST poll fallback). Cloud Run streams SSE fine when
 * hit directly, and the `live` service's CORS allowlist already includes the
 * hosting origin (main.ts corsOptions, credentials:false; the streams are
 * public so EventSource's no-auth-header limitation is a non-issue). So point
 * EventSource straight at that service via NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVE_STREAM_ORIGIN — the
 * market-catalyst-live *.run.app URL, or a custom domain mapped to Cloud Run.
 *
 * Only a REMOTE value is honoured (same guard as the backend override): a
 * localhost value baked into a production build is ignored. Unset -> BASE_URL,
 * which in local dev is localhost:4400 and streams directly with no Hosting in
 * the way, so streaming already works in dev with no env var.
