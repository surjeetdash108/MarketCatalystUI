/**
 * ONE poller for every live price in the app.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Each surface used to run its own timer against its own endpoint: the heatmap
 * polled /live/snapshot every 15s, the stock drawer / movers / watchlist /
 * portfolio / search each polled /live/quotes every 30s, on independent phases.
 * Even after both endpoints were unified onto one server-side cache, two panels
 * could still DISPLAY values a refresh apart — one had fetched 5s ago, another
 * 25s ago — so the same ticker read differently on two parts of the screen.
 *
 * Here every consumer registers the tickers it needs, a single timer fetches the
 * union of them, and the SAME Map instance is handed to all of them. Two
 * components rendering one ticker cannot disagree, because they are literally
 * reading the same object. It also collapses N overlapping requests per interval
 * into one.
