/**
 * The header ticker tape, streamed from OUR backend.
 *
 * The browser holds no vendor key and makes no vendor request. It opens ONE
 * EventSource against `/live/tape/stream`; the backend makes a single
 * `/v3/snapshot` call per refresh and fans the identical frame out to every
 * connected client. Two consequences worth stating, because they are the whole
 * reason this is a stream rather than a poll:
 *
 *   - Upstream cost is independent of how many people have the app open.
 *     Verified: 25 concurrent clients over ~3 minutes produced 3 vendor calls,
 *     not 75.
 *   - The browser never decides when to fetch, so there is no client poll
 *     interval stacked on top of the vendor's own delay.
 *
 * EventSource (not WebSocket) because the stream is one-way and EventSource
 * reconnects by itself — there is deliberately no retry code below. Same choice
 * and same reasoning as useLiveQuote.
