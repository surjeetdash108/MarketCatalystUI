/**
 * Domains this app is actually served from. Firebase Hosting serves the auth
 * helper at `/__/auth/*` on every domain it hosts, so on any of these the
 * sign-in flow can run SAME-ORIGIN.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — mobile Google sign-in was failing outright.
 * `shouldUseGoogleRedirect()` picks `signInWithRedirect` on mobile, and since
 * Firebase JS SDK v9.15 that flow no longer works when `authDomain` differs
 * from the page's own origin: Safari ITP and Chrome's partitioned storage block
 * the third-party state the redirect hand-off depends on, so the user is bounced
 * back with no credential. The app runs on `marketcatalyst.web.app` while
 * `authDomain` pointed at `…firebaseapp.com` — precisely the broken pairing.
 *
 * Pointing `authDomain` at the current host makes the hand-off first-party.
 * Verified 2026-07-22: `https://marketcatalyst.web.app/__/auth/handler` → 200,
 * and the host is listed in the project's authorized domains.
 */
/**
 * ONLY domains whose `/__/auth/handler` is a REGISTERED redirect URI on the
 * OAuth client. A domain that merely serves the handler is not enough — Google
 * rejects the sign-in with `redirect_uri_mismatch` unless the exact URI is
 * listed on the client, which is what broke desktop sign-in on 2026-07-22.
 *
 * Verified against the client on 2026-07-22 by checking whether Google routes
 * the authorize request to the sign-in page (registered) or to
 * `/signin/oauth/error` (not registered):
 *
 *   marketcatalyst.web.app                  REGISTERED   ✓
 *   market-catalyst-502415.firebaseapp.com  REGISTERED   ✓  (the fallback)
 *   marketcatalyst.ai                       NOT registered
 *   marketcatalyst.firebaseapp.com          NOT registered
 *
 * Add a domain here ONLY after adding its handler URI to the OAuth client and
 * re-running that check — otherwise sign-in breaks for everyone on that host.

/**
 * ✅ ON — https://marketcatalyst.web.app/__/auth/handler was registered on the
 * OAuth client (2026-07-22) and verified against Google before enabling.
 *
 * `authDomain` determines the OAuth `redirect_uri` for BOTH the popup and the
 * redirect flow — it is not a mobile-only setting. Switching it to
 * `marketcatalyst.web.app` made Google reject every sign-in with
 * `Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch`, because only the
 * `…firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler` URI is registered on client
 * `741318166823-p0cpiffaf8qcipbvsb1s1jq40eb7br6b.apps.googleusercontent.com`.
 * That broke desktop sign-in, which had been working.
 *
 * TO ADD ANOTHER DOMAIN (e.g. marketcatalyst.ai):
 *   1. Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials
 *   2. Open the OAuth 2.0 Web client id above
 *   3. Under "Authorised redirect URIs" add https://<domain>/__/auth/handler
 *   4. Confirm Google accepts it, then add the host to
 *      SELF_HOSTED_AUTH_DOMAINS below. Do NOT add it before confirming —
 *      an unregistered URI breaks sign-in for everyone on that host.
